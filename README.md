# state-estimation-rust

This project contains re-implementations of an assignment I did for my state estimation course. I originally wrote it in Python and re-implement it in rust for the purposes of exploring the language. 

For more details, please visit my [project page](http://www.ajanda.ca/projects/rust)

# Setup

This setup assumes you already have python 3.8 or greater and rust already installed.
## Download data

First, we need to download the dataset used for the project. To do this on a unix system, use:

```bash
wget https://files.ajanda.ca/state-estimation/data.mat
```
